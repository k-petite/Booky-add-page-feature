    <h1>The Boooook!</h1>

    <p>'Are you nervous, that we are going to Turkey again?'
      asked Batur while he was packing his useless things
      in a really big backpack. This bag was at least 10 years
      old for sure and reallly tired after all those carrying
      all these unnecesary things. His umbrella, cigarette boxes,
      several books, wallet, a zippo, a bunc of magaiznes, parfumes,
      you name it, they were all there. Ok, enough about Batur.</p>

    <p>'Why would I be? I love Turkey darling. You know that.
      Ok, last time there was a coup attempt but I don't see
      any reasons  that will happen again.' She was really happy
      to visit Turkey again, especially the parks. There was the
      salty chef's restaurant that she wanted to try, anda bunch
      of good old culturel Turkish food. After Russia's wheather
      Turkey was heaven for her and she would have the chance
      to swim at last. Why would she be nervous for god's sake.</p>
